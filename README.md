### Why Do You Need Energy and Rubies in Family Island?

In **Family Island**, two essential in-game resources drive your progress: **Energy** and **Rubies**.

1. **Energy** is crucial for completing tasks and exploring different areas of the island. You need energy to chop trees, mine ores, harvest crops, and interact with various parts of the game world. Without sufficient energy, you can find yourself stuck, waiting for it to regenerate or relying on purchases to move forward.
   
2. **Rubies** are the premium currency in Family Island, used to speed up processes, buy special items, and unlock exclusive content. They can be quite difficult to accumulate, but they are highly sought after because they provide a way to bypass long wait times and enhance your gameplay experience. 

Having a good balance of both energy and rubies is key to progressing quickly, unlocking new features, and enjoying the game without any interruptions.
